            <div class="questions">
                <div>Q1. What is white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A1. White water rafting is an adventurous water activity that involves navigating through turbulent and fast-flowing rivers in an inflatable raft. It provides an exciting and adrenaline-pumping experience as you navigate rapids and enjoy the beauty of nature.</p>
                <div>Q2. Is white water rafting safe?</div>
                <p class="answer">A2. While white water rafting can be thrilling, it is generally safe when proper safety guidelines are followed. It is important to choose a reputable and experienced rafting outfitter, wear appropriate safety gear such as helmets and life jackets, and listen to the instructions of your guide.</p>
                <div>Q3. Do I need prior experience to go white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A3. No prior experience is necessary for most white water rafting trips. There are different levels of difficulty, ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced, so you can choose a trip that matches your skill level and comfort. Trained guides will provide instructions and ensure your safety throughout the journey.</p>
                <div>Q4. What should I wear while white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A4. It is recommended to wear quick-drying clothing such as swimsuits, board shorts, or lightweight synthetic materials. Avoid wearing cotton as it tends to stay wet and can make you feel cold. Additionally, bring a pair of secure footwear, like water shoes or sandals with straps, to protect your feet.</p>
                <div>Q5. What equipment is provided for white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A5. Typically, the rafting outfitter will provide you with the necessary equipment, including a helmet, personal flotation device (life jacket), and a paddle. They may also offer wetsuits or splash jackets depending on the weather conditions and water temperature.</p>
                <div>Q6. What should I bring with me on a white water rafting trip?</div>
                <p class="answer">A6. You should bring a change of clothes, a towel, sunscreen, sunglasses with straps, a waterproof camera if desired, and any personal medication you may require. It's advisable to check with the outfitter beforehand for specific recommendations.</p>
                <div>Q7. Are there age or weight restrictions for white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A7. Age and weight restrictions may vary depending on the outfitter and the difficulty level of the trip. Many outfitters have minimum age requirements, typically around 6-8 years old, and may have weight limits for safety reasons. It's best to check with the rafting company to ensure you meet their criteria.</p>
                <div>Q8. What are the different difficulty levels of white water rafting?</div>
                <p class="answer">A8. White water rapids are classified on a scale of I to VI, with Class I being the easiest and Class VI being extremely difficult and dangerous. Most commercial rafting trips cater to beginners and intermediate rafters, ranging from Class I to Class IV rapids.</p>
                <div>Q9. What happens if I fall out of the raft?</div>
                <p class="answer">A9. It is possible to fall out of the raft, especially in more challenging rapids. However, your guide will provide safety instructions on how to handle such situations. They will teach you how to float on your back with your feet downstream, and the raft will be maneuvered to pick you up. Wearing a life jacket is crucial for buoyancy and safety.</p>
                <div>Q10. Can I bring my camera or phone on the raft?</div>
                <p class="answer">A10. While it's exciting to capture memories, the water and rapids can pose a risk to electronic devices. It is recommended to use waterproof cameras or GoPros securely mounted on your helmet or raft. Many rafting companies also offer photo or video services, allowing you to purchase professionally taken pictures or videos of your experience.</p>
