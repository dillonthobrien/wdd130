            <p>Hi, I'm Dillon O'Brien. I'm majoring in accounting and this is my third semester here.</p>
            <p>I was born in Texas and I love outdoor activities. I grew up loving baseball and I really wasn't a big reader but I absolutely loved the maze runner books.</p>
            <p>I recently grew a love for computers and wanted to learn a lot more about them and just web development in general.</p>
            <p>I look forward to meeting you all and seeing what y'all can do with the skills we learn!</p>
